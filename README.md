# image-to-text-converter-using-Java
This repository aims to develop an application that can be used to translate the images of any format to the text format.   
Features - It convert the standard font texts and handwritten texts from image files into editable text files.  
Technology - Java  
IDE - NetBeans

Limitations -
Some strips condition for letters already defined (particularly for A, B, C & D only). So, accordingly more strips conditions can be applied for rest letters.
The first co-ordinate (0,0) of the image should not be the portion of text.
The handwritten text extracting process is successful for few letters yet.
The joining portion of the hand written text should not have more thickness.
